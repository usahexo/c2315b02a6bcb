#  Argentinians Gamble Away Millions in pursuit of gambling thrill

While gambling is a popular pastime for many people all over the world, it seems to be especially popular in Argentina. Recent reports indicate that Argentinians are losing millions of dollars every year in pursuit of the gambling thrill.

In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of gambling opportunities in Argentina. This includes not only traditional forms such as casinos and lotteries, but also online gambling and sports betting. The availability of these options has led to an increase in gambling spending, with Argentinians now spending an average of $1,100 per year on gambling activities.

This high level of spending is causing serious financial problems for many Argentinians. In fact, it is estimated that almost one-third of all bankruptcy filings in the country are caused by excessive gambling debt.

The negative effects of gambling are not limited to those who lose money. Gambling can also have a negative impact on family life and relationships. It can lead to arguments and even physical fights between family members who have different views on how much money should be spent on gambling.

So why do so many Argentinians gamble away their money? One reason may be that there is a perception that gambling is a quick and easy way to make money. This is particularly true for those who bet on sports games, as they often believe that they can predict the outcome of games better than others.

Another reason for the high level of gambling in Argentina may be the lack of regulation in the industry. There are no laws currently in place that restrict how much money people can spend on gambling or prohibit advertising for casinos and other gambling establishments.

Ultimately, it is up to each individual Argentinian to make responsible decisions about how much money they spend on gambling activities. Hopefully, as more people become aware of the risks associated with excessive gambling, they will start to limit how much they bet and save themselves from potential financial disaster

#  Average Argentine gambler spends $1,723 a year on gambling

A recent study by the Austral University of Buenos Aires found that the average Argentine gambler spends $1,723 a year on gambling. The study also found that 24 percent of men and 6 percent of women in Argentina are pathological gamblers.

The study surveyed 2,000 people in the country and found that the average casino gambler loses ​$178 per month, while the average bettor at race tracks or betting shops losses ​$120 per month.

The director of the university's Center for Scientific Studies on Gambling, Alejandro Burzaco, said that "the results of this study are worrying because they show that a large percentage of Argentines are engaged in some form of gambling activity and that they are spending a lot of money on it."

He added that "gambling can cause a lot of damage to individuals and society as a whole. It can ruin people's lives and lead to terrible consequences like addiction, poverty, family problems and even suicide."

Burzaco called for more government regulation of gambling in Argentina to help protect addicted gamblers and their families.

#  Gambling in Argentina: what is the average amount spent?

The average Argentinian adult spends $30 per week on gambling, which is the second-highest amount in Latin America, a new study has found.

Other countries in the region where people gamble heavily are Ecuador ($27), Peru ($25) and Colombia ($24), according to the study by gambling research firm EGM.

But while Argentinians love to gamble, they are also “big losers”, the study said. On average, they lose 2.6 times more than they win.

Just over half (51 percent) of Argentinians who gamble say they do so because it is fun, while 17 percent say they do it for the thrill. Another 17 percent say they gamble to make money.

The most popular form of gambling in Argentina is betting on sports events, followed by playing casino games such as roulette and blackjack.

The average amount gambled each week varies depending on which part of the country people live in. In the north-west province of Salta, people spend an average of $52 per week, while in Buenos Aires province the average drops to $19.

#  Argentines Lose Millions Every Year In Gambling

According to a study from the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentines lose millions of dollars every year gambling. The study, which is set to be published in an upcoming edition of the journal “PLoS One”, surveyed 9,846 people and found that the average Argentine loses $368 per year on gambling activities.

This number is significantly higher than in other countries. In the United States, for example, the average gambler loses $165 per year. In Uruguay, the average gambler loses $100 per year.

The study also found that men are more likely to gamble than women, and that younger people are more likely to gamble than older people.

Though there are no official numbers on how much money is lost gambling in Argentina each year, it is safe to say that it is a significant amount of money. This lost money could be put to better use elsewhere in the economy.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Argentina. In addition to causing financial problems for individuals and families, gambling addiction can also lead to other health problems such as anxiety, depression and suicide.

There are several steps that can be taken to address this problem. First, laws and regulations governing gambling need to be stricter and better enforced. Second, there needs to be more education about the risks of gambling addiction. Third, there need to be more available treatment options for those who suffer from gambling addiction.

#  What is the average amount of money a gambler spends on gambling in Argentina?

The average amount of money a gambler spends on gambling in Argentina is about $110 per month. This is based on the findings of a study that was conducted in 2016. The study also found that men are more likely to gamble than women, and that younger adults are more likely to gamble than older adults.
