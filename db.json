The explosion happened just after 11pm last night, when a group of gamblers were playing American roulette.\n\nEyewitnesses say that the game went wrong when one of the players, a woman from Philadelphia, put her entire life savings on red. The ball landed on black, and the woman lost everything.\n\nIn a fit of rage, she began to argue with the other players, and then pulled out a gun and started shooting. In the panic that followed, she accidentally set off the explosives that were hidden in her bag.\n\nThe explosion destroyed the casino and killed dozens of people. It also caused extensive damage to the rest of the resort, including the hotel and golf course.\n\nThe woman from Philadelphia is believed to have died in the explosion, along with around 60 other people. More than 100 people were injured in the blast, some of them critically.\n\nThe casino was one of several gambling establishments in Atlantic City that have been struggling in recent years.

However, it has now been demolished after one player managed to lose $1 million while playing the game.\n\nThe casino’s owner, who asked not to be named, said that he decided to demolish the casino after the player lost his life savings while playing American Roulette. He said: “It’s a terrible tragedy when someone loses all their money, but it’s even worse when they lose their life savings. That’s why I’ve decided to demolish the casino and build something new in its place.”\n\nThe demolition has caused some controversy in Atlantic City, with some people saying that it was unfair to close down the only casino that offered American Roulette.

Many people were left wondering why the casino had to go down, especially when it was one of the oldest and most iconic casinos in the city.\n\nThe story of the casino’s demolition begins with a game of American Roulette. In 2004, the casino’s owner, Donald Trump, lost a $1.5 million bet on a roulette table at the casino. This put Trump in a bind financially and he ended up filing for bankruptcy that year.\n\nTrump’s bankruptcy affected the casino as a whole and it went bankrupt in 2014. The city decided to demolish it as it was deemed unsafe and posed a hazard to the public.\n\nWhile many people may be saddened by the demolition of this historic building, it is important to remember that its closure has led to the creation of new jobs and businesses in the city.

He said: “It’s a terrible tragedy when someone loses all their money, but it’s even worse when they lose their life savings. That’s why I’ve decided to demolish the casino and build something new in its place.”</p>\n<p>The demolition has caused some controversy in Atlantic City, with some people saying that it was unfair to close down the only casino that offered American Roulette.

Many people were left wondering why the casino had to go down, especially when it was one of the oldest and most iconic casinos in the city.</p>\n<p>The story of the casino’s demolition begins with a game of American Roulette. In 2004, the casino’s owner, Donald Trump, lost a $1.5 million bet on a roulette table at the casino. This put Trump in a bind financially and he ended up filing for bankruptcy that year.</p>\n<p>Trump’s bankruptcy affected the casino as a whole and it went bankrupt in 2014. The city decided to demolish it as it was deemed unsafe and posed a hazard to the public.</p>\n<p>While many people may be saddened by the demolition of this historic building, it is important to remember that its closure has led to the creation of new jobs and businesses in the city.

However, there are some rules and regulations you need to be aware of before you start gambling. One such rule is when you have to claim your casino winnings.\n\nGenerally, you will need to claim your casino winnings within a certain time frame. This can vary depending on the casino, but is usually around a week or so. After this time frame has passed, the casino may forfeit your winnings. So make sure you keep track of when you need to claim your cash!\n\nIn some cases, the casino may payout your winnings in smaller installments rather than all at once. This can be advantageous as it allows you to slowly enjoy your gambling wins. However, keep in mind that you will still need to claim these smaller payments within the set time frame. Otherwise, you may lose out on your hard-earned cash!\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Start planning your next gambling trip and make sure you know when to claim those casino wins!\n\n#  How to ensure you get your casino winnings\n\n#\n\nWhen it comes to gambling, one of the most important things to remember is to ensure you get your winnings. This can be done in a number of ways, but here are some tips on how to make sure you get your money.\n\n#\n\nThe first thing to do is read the terms and conditions of the casino you are playing at. This will let you know what is expected of you and what the casino expects from you. It will also outline any restrictions or limitations that may be in place when it comes to payout times and amounts.\n\n#\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to check the payout percentage for the games you are playing. This information can usually be found on the casino website or on an independent website that reviews casinos. The higher the payout percentage, the more likely you are to win money when playing at that casino.\n\n#\n\nMake sure you are familiar with the games you are playing before you start wagering any money. There is no point in playing a game if you don’t understand how it works. Not only will this help increase your chances of winning, but it will also help prevent you from making costly mistakes.\n\n#\n\nBe aware of which games offer the best odds. Blackjack, craps and baccarat all offer better odds than other games, so if you want to increase your chances of winning, these are the games to play. However, remember that these games also require a bit more skill than others, so make sure you know what you’re doing before jumping in headfirst.\n\n#  What happens if you don't claim casino winnings?\n\nWhen you gamble at a casino, you may be lucky and walk away with some extra cash. However, what happens if you don't claim your winnings? This question is not as simple as it seems, and there are several things to consider.\n\nTo start with, casino winnings are considered taxable income in the United States. If you do not claim your winnings, you may end up owing money to the IRS. Additionally, unclaimed casino winnings may be subject to state taxes as well.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether or not the casino is licensed and regulated. In the United States, casinos are licensed by the individual states in which they operate. If the casino does not have a license, it is not legally allowed to operate. If something goes wrong with your wager or if you have any other problems at the casino, you may have difficulty getting your money back if the casino is not licensed.\n\nCasinos that are licensed and regulated are typically much safer to gamble at. They have to comply with certain regulations set forth by the state in which they operate, and this helps protect players' interests. If something does go wrong with your wager, you may be able to get your money back through the casino's customer service department.\n\nIt's also important to remember that unclaimed casino winnings can expire. Most states have a statute of limitations on unclaimed property - usually between three and five years. If you do not claim your winnings within this timeframe, they will likely become the property of the state.\n\nSo, what should you do if you win at a casino? First and foremost, be sure to report your winnings to the IRS as taxable income. Additionally, research whether or not the casino is licensed and regulated - only gamble at casinos that are safe and reputable. Finally, make sure to claim your winnings within the appropriate timeframe or they may become the property of the state.\n\n#  Who can claim casino winnings?\n\nMost people think that if they hit a jackpot at a casino, the money is theirs to keep. That's not always the case, though. Depending on where you live, there may be restrictions on who can claim casino winnings.\n\nIn some states, the casino winners are required to share their good fortune with the house. This is known as \"the house take.\" In other states, the casino can withhold winnings if the player has outstanding debts or unpaid taxes.\n\nThere are also certain restrictions on who can claim jackpots that are won online. Generally, the person who placed the bet is the one who gets to keep the winnings. However, there may be exceptions if the player used a credit card to place the bet. The credit card company may have a claim to the winnings if there was an attempt to defraud them.\n\nSo, before you go out and spend your casino winnings, make sure you check to see if there are any restrictions in your state or jurisdiction. Otherwise, you may find yourself giving some of your hard-earned money back to the house.\n\n#  When do casino winnings expire?\n\nGenerally, casino winnings expire after a certain number of years. For example, in Las Vegas, casinos must pay out winnings within sixty days. If a gambler does not cash out their winnings within that time frame, the casino can withhold the money.\n\nHowever, different states have different rules governing when casino winnings expire. In Pennsylvania, for example, casinos are allowed to hold onto unclaimed money for up to five years. After that time frame, the casinos are required to turn over any unclaimed money to the state government.\n\nSo, when do casino winnings expire? The answer varies from state to state. However, in most cases, unclaimed casino winnings will be forfeited after a certain amount of time has passed.","source":"_posts/When-do-you-have-to-claim-casino-winnings.md","raw":"---\ntitle: When do you have to claim casino winnings\ndate: 2022-10-10 17:37:44\ncategories:\n- Gambling\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  When do you have to claim casino winnings?\n\n Casinos are a great place to try your luck and potentially win some money.

The following tips will help you improve your chances of winning while playing casino video poker machines.\n\nFirst and foremost, know the game. Familiarize yourself with the different types of video poker machines available in casinos and how to play each one. There is no substitute for practicing on free or play money games until you are comfortable with the rules and how to win at each type of machine.\n\nNext, always bet the maximum number of coins allowed on the machine. This will give you the best chance to win the jackpot. If you cannot afford to bet the maximum, try to find a machine that has lower betting minimums.\n\nWhen it comes to which cards to keep and discard, think about what cards would make the best five-card hand. For instance, if you are dealt two jacks and three other low cards, keep the jacks and discard the other three cards. You would then be hoping for two more jacks to come up in order to make a royal flush.\n\nIn general, it is usually better to keep high value cards rather than low value cards since they have a higher chance of making a good hand. However, this is not always the case so it is important to keep track of what kind of hands are being formed on the screen as well as in your hand.\n\nFinally, stay calm and don’t rush your decisions. Pausing briefly before each decision can help ensure that you make the best choice possible.\n\n#  Play Casino Video Poker Machines Like a Pro \n\nCasino video poker machines are one of the most popular games in the casino, and with good reason - they're fun, challenging, and offer potentially lucrative payouts.

Know the Basics\n\nBefore you can play like a pro, you need to know the basics of the game. Video poker is a five-card draw game in which you are dealt five cards and must choose which to discard and which to keep. The goal is to create the best possible hand using any combination of your discards and the cards that are left in the deck.\n\n2. Play Tight\n\nOne of the key things pro players do is play tight - meaning they don't gamble on bad hands. Instead, they wait for strong hands before betting big. This can be tough to do when you're just starting out, but it's important to remember that slow and steady wins the race in video poker.\n\n3. Bet Smart\n\nAnother thing pro players do is bet smart. They don't just bet on every hand; instead, they only bet when they have a strong hand. This increases their chances of winning big bucks when they do hit a winning hand.\n\n4. Use Your Skills Wisely\n\nIn order to play like a pro, you need to use your skills wisely. For example, knowing when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em is essential for success at video poker - as is being able to read the odds correctly. If you can put these skills into practice, you'll be on your way to becoming a pro player yourself!\n\n5. Stay Patient and Stay Focused\n last but not least, one of the most important things pro players do is stay patient and stay focused. This means not getting angry or discouraged if they lose a few hands in a row - after all, it's all part of the game! And it also means staying focused on making smart decisions that will give them the best chance of winning big money.\n\n# Casino Video Poker Strategies: Winning at the Slot Machines \n\nVideo poker is one of the most popular casino games. It is also one of the most strategical games you can play. There are many different video poker variants out there, but the core mechanics of the game remain the same. In this article, we will discuss some basic video poker strategies that will help you win at the slot machines.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is find a video poker variant that suits your playing style and budget. Not all variants are created equal, so it’s important to choose one that offers good odds and a reasonable payback percentage. Once you’ve selected a game, study the paytable and learn which hands offer the best return.\n\nBegin by placing minimum bets until you feel comfortable with the game and understand how to play each hand. It’s also important to know when to fold – if you don’t have anything close to a winning hand, it’s best to fold and move on to the next hand.\n\nOnce you have a basic understanding of how to play the game, start increasing your bets gradually. The key to winning at video poker is to make smart decisions based on the odds and your current hand. If you keep making bad choices, you will eventually lose money – no matter how good your starting hand may be.\n\nWe recommend using a strategy chart when playing video poker. These charts are readily available online and can help you make better decisions while playing. Following a strategy chart will increase your chances of winning, but it’s still important to remember that nothing is guaranteed in casino games.\n\nFinally, always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose!\n\n# How to Win at Casino Video Poker – The Ultimate Guide \n\nThere is no question that casino video poker is one of the most popular casino games.

Following a strategy chart will increase your chances of winning, but it’s still important to remember that nothing is guaranteed in casino games.</p>\n<p>Finally, always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose!</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-to-Win-at-Casino-Video-Poker-–-The-Ultimate-Guide\"><a href=\"#How-to-Win-at-Casino-Video-Poker-–-The-Ultimate-Guide\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to Win at Casino Video Poker – The Ultimate Guide\"></a>How to Win at Casino Video Poker – The Ultimate Guide</h1><p>There is no question that casino video poker is one of the most popular casino games. The attraction of the game comes from the combination of chance and skill involved. In this article, we will discuss how to win at casino video poker.</p>\n<p>The first step is to understand the basic rules of the game. Casino video poker is a five card draw game where you are trying to make the best possible hand. The hands rank in the same order as regular poker, with a royal flush being the best hand and a two pair being the worst hand.</p>\n<p>After you understand the basics, it is important to practice playing the game. One way to do this is to find an online casino that offers free play versions of casino video poker games. This will allow you to practice without risking any money.</p>\n<p>Another important aspect of winning at casino video poker is to know which cards to keep and which cards to discard. In most cases, you will want to keep any cards that will help improve your hand. For example, if you have three hearts and two spades, you would want to keep all five cards since you can make a flush with any four hearts or spades. If you have four clubs and two diamonds, however, you would want to discard one of your clubs in order to make a better hand (two pair instead of one pair).</p>\n<p>One other thing to keep in mind when playing casino video poker is that you want to aim for the highest possible hand. This means that sometimes it is worth keeping a lower ranking hand if it has a good chance of becoming a higher ranking hand on the next draw. For example, if you have two pair (say, two kings and two queens), there is a good chance that you will get another king or queen on the next draw and improve your hand.</p>\n<p>If you follow these tips, you should be well on your way to winning at casino video poker!</p>\n<h1 id=\"Quick-Tips-for-Winning-at-Casino-Video-Poker\"><a href=\"#Quick-Tips-for-Winning-at-Casino-Video-Poker\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Quick Tips for Winning at Casino Video Poker\"></a>Quick Tips for Winning at Casino Video Poker</h1><p>Video poker is one of the most popular casino games, and it’s no wonder why. It’s a relatively simple game to learn but offers plenty of opportunities for strategic play. Here are a few tips to help you win more often when playing video poker:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Know the payouts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the most important things to know when playing video poker is the payout schedule for each variant. You want to make sure you are playing a game that offers good odds, and knowing the payouts will help you make informed choices about which games to play.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Practice your strategy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like any other game, practice makes perfect when it comes to video poker. familiarize yourself with the different hands and strategies, and practice until you can consistently win at the game.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Use optimal betting strategies</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are a number of different betting strategies that can help you increase your chances of winning at video poker. One such strategy is the Martingale system, which allows you to increase your bet after every loss in order to recoup your losses. Another popular strategy is the Paroli system, which allows you to increase your bet after every win in order to take advantage of your hot streak.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Keep track of royal flushes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the biggest payouts in video poker is a royal flush, so it’s important to keep track of how often these occur in each variant you are playing. This will help you determine whether or not it’s worth pursuing certain hands or strategies.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Manage your bankroll wisely</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes players can make when playing video poker is overplaying their bankroll. Make sure to always stick to a budget and only gamble what you can afford to lose. This will help ensure that you enjoy yourself while playing without risking too much money in the process</p>\n"},{"title":"Welcome to the exciting new world of Genesis Casino!","date":"2022-10-18T09:09:44.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Welcome to the exciting new world of Genesis Casino!\n\nIf you’re looking for a quality online casino experience, look no further than Genesis Casino!
